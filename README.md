# **NC - Knews**
Allows user to create their own articles or read other users articles and comments. They can comment and vote on what they like or dislike and make changes to their articles or comments including deleting what is no longer needed.
***
## **Getting Started**
1. Fork from **`GitHub`**: https://github.com/theCodeFox/BE2-NC-Knews
2. `Clone into the directory that you will be working from`
3. Install all dependancies and dev-dependancies *(see Installing below)*
4. **`TDD everything!`**
5. `Deploy` *(see Deployment below)*
6. Play around and most importantly... **_have fun!_**

### **Prerequisites**

`Below is examples of what I used,` (alternatives are available). If you find something that you prefer, please drop me the suggestion on GitHub!
* Command Line Interface: `iTerm/bash`
* Source Code Editor: `Visual Studio Code`
* Object-Relational DB Management System: `Postgres`
* Cross Platform REST client: `Insomnia`
* Hosting Platform: `Heroku`

### **Installing**

Once you have cloned the repo then cd into the directory. 

From here:

**Install dependancies**

```
npm install body-parser express knex pg pg-promise fs
```

**Install dev-dependancies**

```
npm install chai mocha nodemon supertest -D
```

*Optional dev-dependancies*

```
npm install husky -D
extention (VSC) - eslint
```

*Optional nyan reporter `(if you DO NOT want nyan cat to watch over you, please remove ' --reporter nyan' from test script in package.json)`*

```
npm install --save-dev karma-nyan-reporter
```

**Next you will need a knexfile.js** - this will allow you to set which data you are testing with so you don't accidently delete or change something that you really wish you didn't!

It should look something like this:

```js
const { DB_URL } = process.env;
const ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';

const baseConfig = {
  client: 'pg',
  seeds: {
    directory: './db/seeds',
  },
  migrations: {
    directory: './db/migrations',
  },
};

const dbConfig = {
  production: {
    connection: `${DB_URL}?ssl=true`,
  },
  development: {
    connection: {
      database: 'news',
    },
  },
  test: {
    connection: {
      database: 'news_test',
    },
  },
};

module.exports = { ...baseConfig, ...dbConfig[ENV] };
```

**Don't forget a gitignore file!**

```
node_modules
knexfile.js
config   <-- This is where I put anything I was using to manually check data (e.g query.sql) - optional
```

**Finally to migrate and seed:**

```
npm run setup-dbs
npm run make-migration
npm run seed
```

*Here is a little example of the output at endpoint: /api/comments/:comment_id*

```js
{ comment_id: 1,
  author: 'butter_bridge',
  article_id: 9,
  votes: 17,
  created_at: 2017-11-22T12:36:03.389Z,
  body:
   'Oh, I\'ve got compassion running out of my nose, pal! I\'m the Sultan of Sentiment!' }
   ```
***
## **Running the tests**

The automated tests are in the spec folder on route. **To run TDD:**

```
npm test
```

*If you wish to test using a REST client then I would recommend [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)*


### **Break down of end to end tests**

TDD can be found in the spec directory.

**`utils.spec.js` - testing functions needed for seeding**

* **`createArticleRef`** - *tests that it returns an object with keys of title and article_id*
* **`formatArticles`** - *tests that it returns an array of objects with keys of title, topic, author, body, created_at, votes and article_id. Also tests that created_at is an instance of date/time*
* **`formatComments`** - *tests that it returns an array with keys of comment_id, author, article_id, votes, created_at and body. Also tests that created_by is an instance of date/time*
```js
// test
it('returns object with key of article title', () => {
    expect(createArticleRef(testData)).to.eql({ a: 1 });
});
// output
{ a: 1 }
```
**`app.spec.js` - testing endpoints and functionality**
* **`/api - GET`**
  * *tests that user receives endpoints.json in json format. All endpoints tested for error handling for 405 method not allowed and 404 page not found*
* **`/api/topics - GET`**
  * *tests that topic objects exist, are delivered in an array and contain keys slug and description*
* **`/api/topics - POST`**
  * *tests that user posts correct fields (slug and description) and that slug is unique. Error handling tested for bad requests and server errors*
* **`/api/articles - GET`**
  * *test returns array of article objects with keys of author, title, article_id, topic, craeted_at, votes, comment_count and total_articles. Tests that filters results from queries on topic, author or both and that the default sort_by query can be changed to any column and order to asc from desc. If query by topic or author that don't exist it will return 404, otherwise if they just don't have any article attached will return empty article array with total_articles: 0*
* **`/api/articles - POST`**
  * *tests that article object with keys of title, body, topic, author, that both the topic and author exists*
* **`/api/articles/:article_id - GET`**
  * *tests that correct article object is returned, that the article id is in the correct format and that it exists*
* **`/api/articles/:article_id - PATCH`**
  * *tests that the votes can be patched and that it only takes a valid newVote. It will return the updated article with the incremented/decremented vote if the newVote is valid otherwise it will return the original article with the vote unchanged*
* **`/api/articles/:article_id - DELETE`**
  * *tests that it deletes the article and returns a status 204 and no content. It will 404 error if the article doesn't exist*
* **`/api/articles/:article_id/comments - GET`**
  * *tests that it accepts sort_by, order, limit and p (page) queries and returns comments for article using article id. It will return an empty array if *
* **`/api/articles/:article_id/comments - POST`**
  * *tests that comment object given contains username and body and returns with the new posted comment. It tests that the article exists and the comment is valid*
* **`/api/comments/:comment_id - PATCH`**
  * *tests that the votes can be patched and that it only takes a valid newVote. It will return the updated article with the incremented/decremented vote if the newVote is valid otherwise it will return the original comment with the vote unchanged*
* **`/api/comments/:comment_id - DELETE`**
  * *tests that it deletes the comment and returns a status 204 and no content. It will 404 error if the comment doesn't exist*
* **`/api/users - GET`**
  * *tests that user objects exist, are delivered in an array and contain keys username, avatar_url and name*
* **`/api/users - POST`**
  * *tests that user object with keys of username, avatar_url and name is added, that username is unique and fields are not null*
* **`/api/users/:username - GET`**
  * *tests that username exists and returns correct user object*
```r
 77  _-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-__,------,
 0   _-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-__|  /\_/\
 0   _-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_~|_( ^ .^)
     _-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_ ""  ""

  77 passing (8s)
```

### **ESLint & Husky**

These test syntax and keep the code clean for the next dev to work on it. `It is important for code consistancy over time.`

Below is an example of ESLint in action:

```r
NC-Knews/errors/errors.js
  19:3  warning  Unexpected console statement  no-console

âœ– 1 problem (0 errors, 1 warning)
```
***
## **Deployment using Heroku**

1. Log into Heroku using the command line:
```
heroku login
```
2. In the directory where your server exists create heroku named app using command line:
```html
heroku create <app-name>
```
3. Do `git push heroku master`
4. Go to the heroku site and login. Choose your application and provide an `add-on` of `Heroku Postgres`
5. Check that the database exists. Click settings on it, and view the credentials. `Keep an eye on the URI. Don't close this yet!`
6. On your command line, type:
```
heroku config:get DATABASE_URL
```
**NOTE:** If you're in your app's directory, and it is correctly linked as an add on to heroku, `it should display a DB URI string that is exactly the same` as the one in your credentials.

7. Commit any changes, and push to heroku master. `Make sure you migrate and seed prod scripts` **(in order!)** from your package.json. 
15. Review your app with `heroku open`
16. Any issues should be debugged with `heroku logs --tail`!

*Good luck!*
